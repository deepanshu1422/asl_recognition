# ASL Hand Gestures Recognition from the Webcam

This repository is an implementation of using CNN network to identify American Sign Language hand gestures from the webcam and show the output on the screen.

**Demo:**

## Requirements

* `opencv-python`
* `numpy`
* `tensorflow`
* `spellchecker`


## Data Set

Data set was created by me (approximately 1200 images for 1 gesture).

**Data set structure:**
```
|-- img_dataset
|   |-- train # train images ~80%
|       |-- A
|           |-- 0.jpg
|           |-- 1.jpg
|           |-- ...
|       |-- ...
|   |-- test # test images ~20%
|       |-- A
|           |-- 0.jpg
|           |-- 1.jpg
|           |-- ...
|       |-- ...
|   |-- orig_sample # RGB images of ASL gesture (one image for a gesture)
|       |-- A.jpg
|       |-- B.jpg
|       |-- ...
```

## Model Training
For classification model Canny Edge Detector was applied on images.

**Images that are used for model:**

## Run the Script

*You might need to install the [Git Large File Storage](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) to be able to clone the repository.*

```
$ git lfs install
$ git clone https://github.com/ruslan-kl/asl_recognition.git
$ cd asl_recognition
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python asl_recognizer.py
```

**Some instructions:**

* Once started adjust the threshold values for edge detection so you can see just the edges of your palm and fingers.

* Press `S` to start/pause the output generation.
* Press `D` to erase the output section.
* Press `Q` to quit the script.
* `del`, `space` and `nothing` do what they suppose to do.
* Input double `space` to apply `spellchecker` on the last word.
